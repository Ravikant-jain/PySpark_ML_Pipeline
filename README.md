# House Price Prediction with Apache Spark and Linear Regression

**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression, leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Technologies Used**

* **Apache Spark:** A powerful distributed computing framework for processing large datasets.
* **Python:** The programming language used to interact with Spark and implement the project logic.
* **Pandas:** A popular data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
* **NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.
* **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library for Python, providing tools for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

**Key Steps**

* **Data Loading:** Load house price data into a Spark DataFrame.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data, handling missing values and outliers.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
* **Model Training:** Train a linear regression model on the prepared data.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error.

**Additional Features**

* **Feature Selection:** Identify the most important features for predicting house prices.
* **Visualization:** Use visualizations to understand data patterns and model behavior.
